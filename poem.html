  <h1>I Found Her &#128154;</h1>
  <p>In my waking I longed for love, 
I've searched for hints and looked for clues. 
In my waking I longed for love, 
Nothing was real and then...
There was you. 
You. 
All this time I was searching for you. 

I've searched for you in the highest of towers,
In every nook and cranny of every boulevards.
I've searched for you in the deepest of oceans,
Drowning. Drowning in my sea of regrets.
I've searched for you in the spaces between,
Diving into blackholes that were never meant to be stepped on.
I've searched for you in the places I've been through,
Hoping that one day I'd be there with you.
I've searched for you in every open doors,
In every people's passing and all the sky's hue. 
I've searched for you in the eyes of another,
In every fleeting moment, 
In every blinking lights but nothing came close to you;
And there, finally I found it. 
I saw you. I found you. 
I saw you in one of the most unpredictable circumstances, 
I saw you in that one in a billion chance that went above kismets and providence, 
I saw you and pinched up unexpectedly with no buzzing alerts nor whistles blowing. 

I was allured.
I was intoxicated.
I was mesmerized.

You're not just a pretty one with a pretty face, you're entirely something else.
I can't quite explain what you are,
But you're not like the rest.
You're that only flower in a field of grass,
Hidden from a commoner's sight,
Like the moon in a star filled night,
You stand out just like that.
You're different from all I've known, 
A mystic fraction of peculiarity,
Maybe it's what makes you special, 
You are everything but usual.

In my waking I longed for love,
I've searched for hints and looked for clues.
In my waking I longed for love, 
I've searched for hints and looked.
In my waking I longed for love,
I've searched for hints.
In my waking I longed for love,
I've searched...

I blinked once. 
I blinked twice. 
I blinked and looked around... 
Finally, I stopped searching. &#x2764;
